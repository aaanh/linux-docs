# Arch Linux Bare Installation

**Notes**
> This is an abridged version based on <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide> and <https://linuxiac.com/arch-linux-install/>. The purpose is to create a dumbed down guide that blasts past whatever precautions and warnings on the wiki. I. AM. SPEED. (Though is not gonna be as fast as this guy <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8utpbbdj0LQ>)

**Warning**
> Make sure you have backed up all data before proceeding. This includes: your USB devices and your system disks.
>
> **Disclaimer:** Proceed with the setup steps with extreme cautions. You must know what you are doing. I am not held responsible for your negligence.

## Download `.iso` image

[https://archlinux.org/download/](https://archlinux.org/download/)

Example download script (using University of Waterloo repository mirror)

```sh
cd ~/Downloads && curl -O http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/archlinux/iso/2022.02.01/archlinux-2022.02.01-x86_64.iso
```

## Create the USB installation medium with `dd`

```sh
dd if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/somedisk bs=4M conv=fsync oflag=direct status=progress
```

Example:

```sh
dd if=~/Downloads/archlinux-2022.02.01-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M conv=fsync oflag=direct status=progress
```

> Note: Use `lsblk` to list the disks mounted on your system. A USB device should typically be in the form of `sdx`.

## Restart and Boot into the USB

-   Lenovo: <kbd>Enter</kbd> &rightarrow; <kbd>F12</kbd>
-   Dell: <kbd>F12</kbd>
-   ASUS motherboard: <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>F2</kbd>

After a bit of initializations, you should now be staring at the live boot TTY command line as root, denoted by `#`.

## Networking

### Check the interfaces

```sh
ip link
```

If interface, `wlan0` for example, is shown as DOWN, do:

```sh
sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

### Wireless (from [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/lwd#iwctl))

```sh
iwctl
```

```sh
device list
```

```sh
station device scan
```

```sh
station device get-networks
```

```sh
station device connect SSID
```

### Wired

Should run without much configurations. Typically, installation occurs in a DHCP environment.

For static IP configurations

-   IP assignment

    ```sh
    ip address show
    ```

    ```sh
    ip address add address/prefix_len broadcast + dev interfaces
    ```

-   Routing table

    ```sh
    ip route show
    ```

    ```
    ip route add PREFIX via address dev interface
    ```

## Update `pacman` repository listing

    ```sh
    pacman -Syy
    ```

## Create new partition table


> Make sure you have backed up all data before proceeding. These steps assume that you are using a whole disk as installation target.

-   List available disks

    ```sh
    fdisk -l
    ```

-   Create partition table

    ```sh
    cfdisk /dev/sdx
    ```

-   If prompted for label type, select `gpt`.

-   Delete all partitions.

Partition table should be:

| Partition | Type                 | Size             | Format |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| /dev/sda1 | EFI System Partition | 512M             | FAT32  |
| /dev/sda2 | Linux Swap           | 4G               |        |
| /dev/sda3 | Linux Partition      | <kbd>Enter</kbd> | EXT4   |

-   Write changes to disk.

## Formatting the partitions

-   EFI System:

    ```
    mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1
    ```

-   Linux Swap:

    ```sh
    mkswap /dev/sda2
    swapon /dev/sda2
    ```

-   Linux Partition `/`:

    ```sh
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
    ```

## Install Arch Linux

-   Mount root partition on system disk to live boot environment

    ```sh
    mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
    ```

-   `pacstrap`-ing

    ```
    pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware sudo vim
    ```

> If PGP signature is not trusted, keyring needs to be updated.

    ```
    pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
    ```

## System Configurations

-   fstab

    ```sh
    genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
    ```

-   Change root into the installed system

    ```
    arch-chroot /mnt
    ```

-   Timezone

    ```sh
    ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime
    ```

-   Locale

> This `sed` script needs to be verified!!

    ```sh
    sed -i 's/#en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8/' /etc/locale.gen
    sed -i 's/#en_US ISO-8859-1/en_US ISO-8859-1/' /etc/locale.gen
    ```

Or manually:

    ```
    vim /etc/locale.gen
    ```

-   Locale (cont.)

    ```sh
    locale-gen
    echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    ```

-   Hostname

    ```sh
    echo "your-pc-name-of-choice" > /etc/hostname
    ```

    ```sh
    echo -e "127.0.0.1\tlocalhost\n::1\t\tlocalhost\n127.0.1.1\tyour_pc_name" > /etc/hosts
    ```

Should look something like this

```
# /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost
::1         localhost
127.0.1.1   your-pc-name
```

-   Set root password

    ```
    passwd
    ```

## Install grub bootloader

```sh
pacman -S grub efibootmgr os-prober mtools
```

```sh
mkdir /boot/efi
mount /dev/sda1/ /boot/efi
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id=grub_uefi
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Install Desktop Environment of choice

### Prerequisites

-   Install Xorg

    ```sh
    pacman -S xorg-server xorg-apps
    ```

-   Install GPU drivers

    ```sh
    # NVIDIA
    pacman -S nvidia-utils

    # AMD
    pacman -S xf86-video-ati

    # Intel
    pacman -S xf86-video-intel
    ```

### Desktop Environments

Not all DE's are covered here. Only the 2 most used: gnome and kde. For other DE's, the Arch wiki covers them all.

-   GNOME

    ```sh
    pacman -S gnome gnome-extra networkmanager
    systemctl enable gdm
    systemctl enable NetworkManager # THIS SHIT IS CASE-SENSITIVE
    ```

-   KDE

    ```sh
    pacman -S xorg plasma plasma-wayland-session kde-applications networkmanager
    systemctl enable sddm.service
    systemctl enable NetworkManager # THIS SHIT IS CASE-SENSITIVE
    ```

## Create a user account

```sh
useradd -m -G wheel account_name
passwd account_name
EDITOR=vim visudo
```

-   Find and uncomment the line `# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL`

> In `vim` Normal Mode, type `/%wheel ALL=(ALL)` to search for that line. If you feel lazy, in Normal Mode, type `:set ignorecase` to ignore case for search query.

## Finalization

```sh
exit
umount -R /mnt
reboot
```

After the reboot, it should boot straight into the Arch installation on your system (assuming you have only 1 disk, 1 OS installed, lol).
