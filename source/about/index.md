# About

This documentation is built using [Sphinx Documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) framework that runs on Python. The theme is [Furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart/). The deployment uses GitHub Action for CI and rsync's iterative updates to my private webserver running Nginx on Debian 9 on a Linode VM.
